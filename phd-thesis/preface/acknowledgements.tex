For as long as I can remember I have aspired to be an astrophysicist and, while I have never lost that passion for astronomy, it would not remain so resolute without the unwavering support of those around me. I offer my sincere gratitude and thanks to:
\\
\\
% For Brooke
My supervisor Brooke Simmons. Your guidance, enthusiasm and support over these many years have made this work possible. I left every single meeting inspired and encouraged, ready to work harder than before.
\\
\\
% For collaborators
My many collaborators: Bruno Merin, Chris Lintott, Mike Walmsley, Becky Smethurst, Tobias Geron, Sandor Kruk, Kameswara Mantha, Karen Masters, and the whole Galaxy Zoo Team who were all so supportive, insightful and inspiring throughout my PhD. 
\\
\\
The academics in the department: John Stott, Julie Wardlow, Isobel Hook, Mathew Smith, Young-Lo Kim and Sam Oates. Their help and guidance, especially in the final months of my PhD, was essential.
\\
\\
% Those at ESA
The ESA trainee cohort of 2022. When my love for astronomy was wavering and commitment to academia in doubt you showed me a wonderful, inquisitive and welcoming environment that brought my passion back.
\\
\\
% Those at 1715Labs
The team at 1715Labs. Working with you was a brilliant experience, and gave me a peek behind the curtain into life in industry.
\\
\\
% Those in the office
Those in the Lancaster PhD office, who made it such a welcoming place. To Jamie Dumayne, Brenda Zambrano and Izzy Garland for many nights of excellent tacos. To Heather Wade and Tom Cornish for introducing me to Lancaster. To Rahul Rana, Pascale Desmet, Jon Carrick, Nick Amos, Harry Stevenson and Andrew Milligan for some great laughs, scientific discussion and excellent dinners.
\\
\\
% Matt, Amy and Nikita.
My house mates and close friends: Amy Hewitt, Matthew Thorne, Nikita Mehta and Zach Mason. You're all scattered to the wind excelling at your own things now, but I hope that we will meet again. Until then, I wish you all the success in the world.
\\
\\
% For my parents
Most importantly, my parents. You fanned those initial flames that gave me a passion for astronomy that has never left me. Your support then, and now, has driven me forward. It is only because of you that I have made it this far.
\\
\\
% For my brother and sister
My brother and sister, Michael and Ruth. Thank you for putting up with me, and being amazing people.
\\
\\
% To Calum & Ronan
Calum Cooper and Ronan Duff, who have supported me completely since the day we met you. Even when my decisions lead me to leave you in Glasgow, you still remain my closest friends.
\\
\\
To the University of Glasgow, where I aspired to go throughout my childhood. Learning there gave me the tools to complete and, hopefully, excel at my PhD.
\\
\\
% Lancaster University
This research was funded by the Science and Technology Funding Council of the UK, without them this work would not have been possible.
\\
\\
Finally, to Abby. Know your unwavering support got me through the toughest parts of my PhD. Your selflessness has left an impact on me that will persist for the rest of my life.
