\section{GALAXY INTERACTION}
Galactic interaction plays a fundemntal role in the evolution of galaxies throughout cosmic history. By galaxy interaction, what we mean is the effects and physical processes that occur when to galaxies move close enough together that they begin to have a physical affect upon on another. Most often, these affects are due to gravitational effects. These effects can range from morphological disturbance \citep{}, to
