This thesis is my own work and no portion of the work referred to in this thesis has been submitted in support of an application for another degree or qualification at this or any other institute of learning.

The research presented in Chapter \ref{chapter2} has been published in the relevant scientific journals in paper format and can be found as O'Ryan et al. (2023, ApJ, 948, 1). The contents of Chapter \ref{chapter3} and \ref{chapter4} have been written in the style of publication as they will be submitted.

As this thesis is the combination of three papers, its layout reflects this. Each science chapter begins with an abstract summarising that work and the introduction will often re-introduce the concept of interacting and merging galaxies.
