This is going to be a long one. So, strap in folks.

Becoming an astrophysicist has been a dream of mine for almost as long as I can remember. In 2009, the international year of astronomy, I was given my first telescope (a Â£60 30cm refractor from Tesco) and with that I was hooked. Not only did I spend every clear, freezing North Ayrshire night I could observing but it was also a time of so many events through the year. More than once did I drag my parents to planetarium shows, star parties in Galloway or to find the ever elusive Paisley observatory. I kept them inundated with terrible drawings of my observations, and they put up with me destroying our heating bill by running in and out of the house excitedly explaining what I thought I'd found. They kept my inspiration and interest going by taking me to events across Scotland that I had never heard of. Sleep overs at the Glasgow Science Centre; meeting astronauts, trips to Dynamic Earth, going to EpCot and the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida and even taking me to lectures on cutting edge research at the University of Glasgow that they must've found dull as dishwater. For all that, I want to thank and acknowledge them. Their guidance, patience and dedication at that time, and until now, let me develop the passion and fire for astronomy that forever changed me and set me on this path.

Of course, I must thank my supervisor Brooke Simmons for her guidance, advice and insight throughout my PhD. She is a brilliant astrophysicist, colleague and, I hope, friend. If I'm lucky enough to have a shred of her understanding of astrophysics, her teaching ability or committment to her ideals I would go very far in whatever I do next. I would also like to thank my many other colleagues from across numerous institutions for their guidance and impact on my career. I want to thank Bill Keel, Becky Smethurst, Tobias Geron, Karen Masters, Mike Walmsley, Sugata Kaviraj, and all those at the Galaxy Zoo collaboration. You all make it such an inclusive collaboration, and a fundamentally easy place to fit in and work. I, especially, want to acknowledge Chris Lintott whose advice has helped throughout my PhD. I also want to thank him for his show `The Sky at Night', which I consumed endless magazines and episodes of throughout my childhood. Him, and the late Sir Patrick Moore, were part of lighting that original fire for astronomy that burns to this day.
